			<h1>Intro.</h1> 
			<p><b>I’ve always had an interest for 3d printing, the limitless options to create fascinates me the same way as I’m drawn to designing (games and interactive applications), an 3D printer is also a great tool for prototyping. When I saw a nice offer during the quarantine I decided to give it a try and to buy my own 3D printer. The model that I decided to buy after extensive online research was the Ecubmaker ToyDiy 4-in-1 next to 3D printing it also offers CNC engraving and laser burning as functionalities which enables me limitless possibilities to create and design.

			<h1>First print</h1>
			<p>When I received the printer, I was glad that it was already montaged and calibrated when so I could use it right away. I started with printing a small box that removes dust and irregularities from the filament before it goes into the machine to avoid blockages while printing.</p>

			<h1>Fixing problems</h1>	
			<p>Although my first print was perfect it didn’t stay that way, of course. When I printed more models I quickly discovered that the filament could get stuck, the z-axis could be wrongly calibrated, or the print temperature could be a bit off. In short 3D printing and solution-oriented thinking are connected to eachother. I’m glad that there is a lot of information about 3D printing and its problems online so that I can find aid with issues that I experience while printing. I also started to write down my own experiences and solutions so that I can use information if I come across a similar problem again.</p>

			<h1>Printing own designs </h1>	
			<p>After I printed a few designs that I downloaded from the internet, 3D printing started to become a bit like printing normal documents (but then noisier and more tedious). To give myself some challenge I decoded to make my own models to print. Although I have some experience with Maya (a program to make 3D models) I decided to search for better alternatives since I always have a hard time to find the exact measurements of models in Maya. When I found Fusion 360 I thought that it would be easy for me to use, since its owned by the same company as Maya (Autodesk). Sadly enough that’s not true, but I was able to make and print some basic shapes. I hope that I will be able to make and print more complex designs as I continue to practice with Fusion 360.
